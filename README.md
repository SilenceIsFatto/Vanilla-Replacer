# Vanilla-Replacer

~- NOT COMPLETE, READ THE DOCUMENTATION.TXT FOR MORE INFO ~-

This project combines both Python and SQF to create a loadout exporter/overwriter.

All you need to do is put down your base unit in the editor (E.g CSAT Rifleman), and copy paste it. 
You can then create a different loadout on the new unit, and sync it to the base unit, running the script.
That script then exports a mod folder, complete with a config.cpp and .hpp files for your new units.
